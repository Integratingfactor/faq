## What is iF Login?

Security is not just about hiding stuff. No matter how much one tries to hide, it will be found.

Our focus should be to enable security with protection using proper authorization checks. Lets attack the problem, instead of trying to hide from it.

IDP service from Integratingfactor.com is enabling this security model as following:
* provide tools that allow developers implement security with proper authentication and RBAC checks in their application (_regardless of whether they are writing blogs, or hospital IT solutions_)
* provide framework that promotes adoption of solid security habits by end users, even for day to day mundane operation (_because that's where the breach starts_)
* provide services that reduce liability and increase profitability for businesses (_making security an ongoing journey, not just a one time implementation_)
